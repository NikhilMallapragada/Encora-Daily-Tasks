#  Employee–Order Microservices System  
A microservices-based system demonstrating **synchronous communication** between services using **Spring Boot** and **REST APIs**.

---

##  Project Overview  
This project showcases a **simple and modern microservices architecture** where two independent services — **Employee Service** and **Order Service** — communicate **synchronously** using **RESTful APIs**.  

The **Order Service** provides product/order information, and the **Employee Service** fetches that information via HTTP calls using Spring’s `RestTemplate`.  
This setup is ideal for understanding how one service can directly interact with another in a **request–response** manner.

---

##  Architecture  

The system follows a **two-service microservices architecture** pattern with **synchronous communication**:

- **Order Service** → Manages order information (ID, name, price)  
- **Employee Service** → Requests order data from Order Service and provides combined responses  

 **System Flow**
Client → Employee Service → Order Service → Employee Service → Response

---

##  Features  

-  **Order Management:** Fetch order details by ID  
-  **Employee Service:** Retrieves and processes order info  
-  **Synchronous REST Communication:** Real-time request–response between services  
-  **Inter-service Call Using RestTemplate**  
-  **Scalable & Modular:** Each service runs independently

##  Project Modules  

###  **Order Service**
- Manages and returns product/order data  
- Provides REST endpoint to retrieve orders by ID  

**Package Structure:**
com.ordertest.Emp_Order_Service
│
├── Model/
│ └── Order.java
│
├── Controller/
│ └── OrderController.java
│
└── EmpOrderServiceApplication.java


---

###  **Employee Service**
- Calls Order Service using `RestTemplate`  
- Merges the response with additional messages  

**Package Structure:**
com.employeetest.Emp_Employee_Service
│
├── model/
│ └── Employee.java
│
├── controller/
│ └── EmployeeController.java
│
└── EmpEmployeeServiceApplication.java


---

##  Prerequisites  

- **Java 21+**  
- **Maven 3.8+**  
- **Spring Boot 3.0+**  
- Any IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code)  

---

##  Setup Instructions  

###  Run **Order Service**
```bash
cd Emp_Order_Service
mvn spring-boot:run
Runs on port 8081

##  Communication flow 

The client sends a request to Employee Service (/employee/getOrder/{id})

Employee Service calls Order Service (/Order/{id}) using RestTemplate

Order Service returns order data

Employee Service adds a success message and returns a combined response

## Key Learnings

Understand synchronous inter-service communication

Use RestTemplate for calling other microservices

Learn microservice separation and modular design

Observe how one service depends on another in real time

## Future Enhancements

 Integrate Swagger UI for API documentation

 Replace RestTemplate with Feign Client for cleaner code

 Add Service Discovery (Eureka) for dynamic service lookup

 Add centralized logging and monitoring

 Implement Asynchronous Communication with Kafka or RabbitMQ
